Puzzles with UCT search
===========================
AHN, Apr 2020

Abstract
----------

We try reinforcement learning where v = exp(-lambda*remaining_effort).
The policy is a constant. The search is UCT.

We start with simple puzzle states, which are close to the solution, and then scale up to harder initial configurations.
